# Final Project Hints: Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## General Tips

1. **Understand the Dataset**  
   - Explore the dataset thoroughly before modeling. Look for patterns, trends, and anomalies.  
   - Ensure you handle missing values and outliers appropriately.

2. **Feature Scaling**  
   - Normalize your data (e.g., using Min-Max scaling) to ensure compatibility with LSTM models.  
   - Pay special attention to scaling the features that directly impact predictions, like closing prices.

3. **Data Splitting**  
   - Use an 80-10-10 split for training, validation, and testing datasets.  
   - Maintain temporal order in the dataset when splitting, as LSTMs rely on sequential data.

4. **Model Design**  
   - Start with a simple LSTM architecture, then iterate by tuning hyperparameters.  
   - Add layers cautiously, as deeper models may overfit small datasets.

5. **Handling Overfitting**  
   - Use techniques like dropout, early stopping, and reducing the number of epochs.  
   - Monitor training and validation loss to avoid overfitting.

6. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Use metrics like MSE, MAE, or RMSE to measure performance.  
   - Lower values of these metrics indicate better performance.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Ignoring Data Trends**  
   - Ensure the data represents the current market conditions. Use recent datasets for training.  
   - Be cautious of seasonal patterns or anomalies in the data.

2. **Overcomplicating the Model**  
   - Start simple and scale up. Overcomplicated models may lead to poor generalization.  
   - Use simpler benchmarks (e.g., ARIMA or linear regression) to compare performance.

3. **Improper Validation**  
   - Use the validation set correctly. Avoid using test data for hyperparameter tuning.  
   - Cross-validate with multiple time splits for more robust results.

## FAQ : How to use LSTM here?
- Consider dealing with a sequence of prices as training data input and the next price as training data output.
- You can get many such sequences from the stock price data (by taking a slice of the dataset).
