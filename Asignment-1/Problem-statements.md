# Programming Assignment: Problem Statements

This assignment includes 10 programming problems designed to test elementary Python programming skills along with basic usage of libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Complete the function definitions for each problem and test them with the provided examples.

---

## 1. Basic Loop and Condition
Write a function to:
1. Print all even numbers from a given list.
2. Calculate and return the sum of all odd numbers in the list.

---

## 2. Simple String Manipulation
Write a function to:
1. Reverse a given string.
2. Count the number of characters in the string.

---

## 3. Prime Number Check
Write a function to check if a given number is prime. The function should return `True` if the number is prime, otherwise `False`.

---

## 4. NumPy: Array Manipulation
Write a function to:
1. Create a NumPy array of integers from 1 to 10.
2. Replace all odd numbers with -1.
3. Return the modified array.

---

## 5. NumPy: Matrix Operations
Write a function that takes two 2x2 matrices \( A \) and \( B \) and:
1. Computes \( A + B \).
2. Computes \( A \times B \) (matrix multiplication).
3. Returns the transpose of \( A \).

---

## 6. Pandas: DataFrame Creation and Filtering
Write a function to:
1. Create a Pandas DataFrame with columns `Name`, `Age`, `Marks`.
2. Add a new column `Passed` where `Marks > 50`.
3. Filter and return rows where `Passed` is `True`.

---

## 7. Pandas: Reading and Filtering CSV
Write a function to:
1. Load a CSV file with columns `City, Temperature, Rainfall`.
2. Filter and return rows where `Temperature > 30`.
3. Calculate and return the average `Rainfall`.

---

## 8. Matplotlib: Line Plot
Write a function to:
1. Plot a line graph for \( y = 2x + 1 \) for \( x \) ranging from -5 to 5.
2. Label the X-axis and Y-axis.
3. Add a title to the graph.

---

## 9. Matplotlib: Pie Chart
Write a function to:
1. Create a pie chart to show the distribution of fruits in a basket:
   - Apples: 30, Bananas: 20, Oranges: 50.
2. Add labels to each section.

---

## 10. Data Analysis and Visualization
Write a function to:
1. Create a DataFrame with student names, marks in Math, and marks in Science.
2. Calculate the average marks for each student.
3. Plot a bar chart showing the marks in Math and Science for each student.
