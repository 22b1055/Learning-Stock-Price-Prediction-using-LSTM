# Introduction to Neural Networks : Problem Statements

This assignment includes 2 questions. Problem-1 is optional (you can definitely try it out). First problem deals with coding from scratch. Second problem involves coding using libraries.

---

## 1. Neural Network from Scratch (Optional)
Complete the python code for all the functions in ```q1.py```.

---

## 2. Handwritten Digit Classification using Neural Networks
Build a neural network model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Your goal is to develop a neural network that accurately predicts the digit (0-9) in each image from the dataset.
Make progress to the python code for in ```q2.ipynb```.
