# Week-3 : Introduction to Neural Networks
This is the core topic, a sudden jump to the world of Artificial Intelligence. The concepts of neuroscience has been incorporated into computer science leading to learning models, much similar to function of neurons in nervous system.
This week will be a hectic one, covering general neural network architecture from scratch.

## Video Lecture Series for Conceptual Understanding of Neural Networks
Please refer to this video lecture series for learning Neural Networks. This will give a good insight to this topic.

## Video Lecture Series for Coding Neural Networks from Scratch (Optional)
This video lecture series will introduce you to coding Neural Networks from scratch i.e. without using any in-built ML library.

#### This part is optional as, in the final project, you will be using only libraries. But, you are free to enjoy coding neural networks by hand.

**Have fun Guys!!**
