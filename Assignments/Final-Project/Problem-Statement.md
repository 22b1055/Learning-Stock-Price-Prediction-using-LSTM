# Final Project: Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## Problem Statement

Develop and evaluate a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based model to predict the closing stock prices of a publicly listed company using historical stock market data. The project aims to demonstrate your understanding of time series forecasting, data preprocessing, and deep learning model implementation.

## Requirements

1. **Data Acquisition**  
   - Use historical stock price data of your chosen company (e.g., from Yahoo Finance or similar sources).  
   - The dataset should include features like date, open, high, low, close, and volume.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values, normalize the data, and prepare it for time series modeling.  
   - Split the data into training, validation, and testing datasets.

3. **Model Design**  
   - Build an LSTM model using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch).  
   - Include key hyperparameters such as the number of LSTM units, learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

4. **Training and Validation**  
   - Train the LSTM model on the training data and validate it using the validation set.  
   - Apply techniques like early stopping or dropout to prevent overfitting.

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the test data.  
   - Visualize the predicted vs. actual stock prices for better interpretability.

6. **Insights and Reporting**  
   - Analyze the results and discuss the challenges encountered during the project.  
   - Highlight the strengths and limitations of the LSTM model for stock price prediction.

## Deliverables

1. A well-documented Python notebook/script with all steps clearly explained.  
2. Visualizations of data trends, training progress, and prediction results.  
3. A presentation summarizing the approach, findings, and conclusions.

This project is designed to showcase your ability to work with real-world data, apply machine learning concepts, and interpret model results effectively.
